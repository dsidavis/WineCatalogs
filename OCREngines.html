  <h2>OCR Engines</h2>

  There are 3 OCR engines we have considered,
  1 open source (tesseract) and 2 commercial
  (Abbyy Reader and PDFPenPro).

<p>  
  We have processed all of the wine catalog images via PDFPenPro
  and are willing to reprocess specific images with different preprocessing.

<p>
  You can process 
    <dl>
	<dt>tesseract
          <dd>
	    Interfaces from R and Python.
	    <ul>
	      <li> <a href="https://github.com/duncantl/Rtesseract">Rtesseract</a>
	      <li> <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pytesseract/">pytesseract</a>
  	      <li> <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tesseract/index.html">tesseract</a>
	    </ul>  

	<dt>Abbyy
            <dd>
		<ul>
    		    <li> Online/Web API with support for processing a small number for free.
			You need to register and get authentication codes.
 		<li> Can return the results in various formats: XML, DOCX, ...
   		<li> <a href ="process.py">Python code to submit an image to the Web API</a>
               <li> <a href="readAbbyyXML.R">R code</a> to read the resulting XML documents from Abbyy.
		</ul>
	    
	<dt> PDFPenPro
            <dd> PDFPenPro is an application on can purchase and process individual images or entire scanned
		documents. It does more than OCR.
		<ul>
		    <li> 
                </ul>		    
		
    </dl>
